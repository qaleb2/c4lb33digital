    title: 'Cold Water',
    subtitle: 'There is an Island in the tropics. On most of the island, the wholesome sun pierces through foliage and pushes away darkness, illuminating an environment teeming with life and energy, positivity. A tropical paradise with beaches that kiss your feet as you walk across it. At the center of this island is a lagoon, situated within a cave, with pockets of sunlight losing battle against ominous tides of shadow, every bit containing infinite shades of chaos and darkness. You find yourself floating in the water, with a beam of sunlight shining through the rocky ceiling like a spotlight. The stage spreads across your vision, and the darkness, like crowds of people, judges you with its threatening gaze, the sound of water almost like murmurs, weighing your heart down into the bottomless lagoon. What are they saying? Could be curses, could be booing. You see a light-the exit to this cagelike cave, but your heart feels like fetters and your soul like the chain that wants to descend as you desperately swim towards the light. The sounds slowly mutate into taunting and eerie noises, and anxiety takes a hold of you, your control over your body fades and you slowly sink, letting everything go. Lights dim, darkness takes over. Gasping for air, you realize you are alive, despite being submerged. More alive than ever, in fact. These breaths feel as real as when you jolt awake from a nightmare, but instead, this time you are descending further down one. Further down the bottomless dread pit you sink, anything could be down there, the unknown. You feel like your life is being drained, and the sole fact that you are breathing and alive barely holds your mind from ripped to shreds by chaos. It feels like there is something down there, something important, but also cold. It feels like any moment, you will be able to get out of this mess, and go back to paradise, but that moment never comes. Then, as uneventfully as you appeared on the island, you emerge in a new place, and it’s neither paradise nor limbo. You’re in a shower. It is quite cold, but not unbearable, you turn off the water and get out of the shower because you have shit to do.',

    title: 'Chess at Bryant Park',
    subtitle: ['Perhaps as a result of watching too many ted talks of meaningful experiences obtained from having seemingly random and spontaneous interactions with strangers, I decided to venture and interact with strangers. It started with smiling at a girl recording a video of her surroundings in front of the NYPL while disguising myself as a member of the audience for the pianist playing on the public piano. I wanted to be the cute photogenic guy beaming with confidence and energy. She smiled back at me, but I immediately looked away, and left soon after my self awareness slowly settled in to torture me.  My second attempt was at Bryant park. I started by walking around, looking for friendly faces. Some candidates included a cute and friendly looking old lady, some dudes chilling and staring into the distance, a guy who looked like he was an entrepreneur, who was planning what looked like marketing plans on paper. I recalled that Paul Mccartney used to talk to old ladies as a young man, so I slowly walked towards the old lady, curious about what wisdom she had. But then I saw the chess area out of the corner of my eye, and decided to make my way there.'

    'The whole place could easily be mistaken for heaven. Youth and innocence played chess against grey hair and wisdom, this was the essence of New York. There were no differences to put aside in the first place, but differences in looks and personalities were nonetheless more than common. My opponent was a 74 years old man who looked like he had nothing better to do than try to seem smart to strangers in Bryant park. At first delighted by his overestimation of my skills, I quickly realized I was going to disappoint the man when I counted the number of games I played in my life. Eventually, our conversation broke into a series of “I’m sorry, Im not really good” from me, and “Why would you even do that?” from him. Why did it suddenly feel really hot and stuffy? '],

    title: 'The Decision',
    subtitle: 'It is 12:44 AM. A young man sits in a desultory fashion, staring into oblivion as the frail light looms over his desk. He has a fair physique, a fair face, the essence of adolescence barely starting to show through his pitiful amount of facial hair. Like many a young man, he is stuck with the same decision he’s been thinking about since he started school. Well, maybe not a decision. More like, an indecision. There aren’t only two paths at any given moment, in fact, there are infinitely many, he thinks, smirking at the clever phrase he “invented,” and immediately reverts back to a jaded gaze onto his environment. It seems as though the more wisdom he recalls the more difficult this decision becomes. As he zones in on his life, his life zones out for him. ',
