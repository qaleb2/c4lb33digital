    desc: 'In this paper we implemented a neural network approach to predicting market states and a trading strategy \
    to demonstrate our results. In the first part, we classified the training data into bear, bull, and static states\
    using widely accepted market definitions. We then used a non-parametric, rule-based classification algorithm by \
    Lunde and Timmerman into classify bear and bull markets which was included in a R package. In the second part, \
    we train a neural network, and generate predictions using python, using 10% of our training data as our validation\
    data set.',
