# About this website:
I started out trying to create everything from scratch. This was how far I got. (insert link to old webby) Then I gave up because it was too
much work to learn everything, so instead i tried to reverse engineer Michael D'Angelo's (insert link) website which actually ended up
being quite some work as well. I had previously taken some html, css, and js two years ago. That didn't come too handy tbh, had to basically learn
everything including github. I don't think i am going to be too big in UI and web design, but I will make this website my own little world. There
are some things you can explore around that you might find cool. For example, the period to this sentence will lead to my personal website.
