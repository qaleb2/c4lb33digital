# Intro

- I am currently a graduate student studying Mathematical Finance at Boston University. I chose this direction because it involved a combination of coding, pure math, and statistics, all of which I was interested in (Omne Trium Perfectum?). I really wanted to see them applied, and finance was the perfect place where all three are combined.
- This past semester I was enlightened to how linear algebra can be used to create minimum risk and maximum return portfolios (Portfolio theory is very interesting to me). I am excited for next semester, where I will get to see how coding is used in a financial context to perform calculations with cool methods (Fast Fourier Transforms and types of simulations).
- Currently, I am interested in a finance career involving statistical learning, computational problem solving, and some opportunities to invest on the buy side, such as in investment management.


# Some Background about me

- I was born in San Francisco in 1999, and grew up in China from 2001 till 2013. So I spent roughly half my life in China and half in the US.
- I transferred local schools 5 times between kindergarten and 5th grade. I went to American International School of Guangzhou from 5th grade till the first semester of 8th grade, came to the US, and went to school for the second semester of 8th grade at Great Neck South High School till graduation in 2017.
- Being bilingual is pretty weird. I always feel like I am not good enough in either language. I have about an equal amount of English speaking and Chinese speaking friends, and I've had periods of hanging out with one of the two groups more than the other, which would usually drag around my fluency in the one of the two languages ever so slightly.
- My hobbies include listening to and playing music (Trumpet, Piano, and Guitar), powerlifting (S: 205, B: 165, D: 285), and writing.

# About the creation of website:

While I prefer to be original in general, it is just too much effort to reinvent the wheel sometimes. I reverse engineered [Michael D'Angelo's website ](https://mldangelo.com/) which actually ended up being quite some work as well. I had previously taken some HTML, CSS, and JS two years ago, which helped a little.
