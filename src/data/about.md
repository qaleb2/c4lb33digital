# Intro

- Hi. I am currently a student. I will be graduating in January 2023 from the Mathematical Finance and Fintech Program at Boston University. I ended up in Math Finance through a desire to combine coding, pure math, and statistics (Omne Trium Perfectum?,) with practical applications that have a less palpable but more practical impact. I believe investing is a very efficient way one can make an impact on the world. 

# Current Goals
- I am currently trying hard to find a full time job during Quantitative Tightening. 
- I am also working on a Boston Blue Bike data analysis project to figure out how I can incorporate biking into my daily routine
# Some Background about me

- I was born in San Francisco in 1999, and grew up in China from 2000 till 2012. So I spent roughly half my life in China and half in the US.
- I transferred local schools 5 times between kindergarten and 5th grade. I went to American International School of Guangzhou from 5th grade till the first semester of 8th grade. Then my family came to the US, and I went to school for the second semester of 8th grade at Great Neck South High School until graduation in 2017.
- Being bilingual is pretty weird. I always feel like I am not proficient enough in either language. I have about an equal amount of English speaking and Chinese speaking friends, and I've had periods of hanging out with one of the two groups more than the other, which would usually drag around my fluency in the one of the two languages slightly.
- My hobbies include listening to and playing music (Trumpet, Piano, and Guitar), powerlifting (S: 235, B: 165, D: 315), soccer, and writing.

# About the creation of website:

While it would be nice to be original, it is just too much effort to reinvent the wheel sometimes. I reverse engineered [Michael D'Angelo's website ](https://mldangelo.com/) which actually ended up being quite some work as well. I had previously taken some HTML, CSS, and JS two years ago, which helped a little.
