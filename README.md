My personal website. Both Professional and Personal.

To update website:
First make changes in files, then commit to github.

To draft changes on website:
First set cd to c4lb33digital, then do npm start to start localhost 3000. 
Make changes and save them. Do npm restart and start in a new port
Do npx kill-port 3000 to kill previous port after done. 

Some changes automatically update in localhost3000
